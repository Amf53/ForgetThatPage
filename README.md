# Forget That Page  <img src="chromium/img/icon/swipe32.png" />
We all at some point ended up on a webpage that we don't want to appear on our browsing history. Either it's for a gift, or a dumb page...

With "Forget That Page", you can delete from your history the webpage you're on, just in one click !

It's simple but useful, and also open source !
